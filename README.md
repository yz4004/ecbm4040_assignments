# ECBM W4040 2021 Fall

# assignment 1
1. I compiled basic classifiers: logistic regression and softmax classifier, including implementation of all layer functions.
2. I designed and trained a two layers neural network and a multi-layer-perception (MLP) model using numpy. All the layer functions and back-propagation are implement manually, without calling tensorflow.
3. I used tensorflow library to create a MLP model.

# assignment 2
1. Manually implemented 4 optimization method: SGD with Momentum, Adagrad, Adam and Nadam.
2. Manually implemented regularization layers including Dropout and Batch Normalization.
3. Manually implemented image data augmentation functions and trained a CNN model using them.
4. Bottle Kaggle Competition. An in-class Kaggle competition using CNN to detect how much liquid does a bottle have.

# assignment 3
1. RNN application -- XNOR
I built and train an XNOR network that can learn the XNOR function. Data is generated by xnor function.

2. RNN application --Tweet Sentiment Analysis
Fisrt, I encoded the data using one hot encoding and train an LSTM network to classify the sentiment. Thenï¼Œ I replace the one hot encoding with an embedding layer and train another LSTM model.
